/* We assume that right shift corresponds to signed division by 2 with
* rounding towards minus infinity.  This is correct for typical "arithmetic
* shift" instructions that shift in copies of the sign bit.  But some
* C compilers implement >> with an unsigned shift.  For these machines you
* must define RIGHT_SHIFT_IS_UNSIGNED.
* RIGHT_SHIFT provides a proper signed right shift of an INT32 quantity.
* It is only applied with constant shift counts.  SHIFT_TEMPS must be
* included in the variables of any routine using RIGHT_SHIFT.
